The Carpentries develop and teach interactive, hands-on, two-day
workshops for learning core skills in research computing. [Data 
Carpentry workshops](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops/) are domain-specific, and focus on teaching skills
for working with data effectively and reproducibly. [Software 
Carpentry workshops](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/) are domain agnostic, and teach program design, version 
control, testing, and task automation. 

Carpentry workshops are in-person events, generally two days long, and are 
taught by volunteer Instructors. Our Instructors are [trained in pedagogy](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) with
a focus on creating a motivating and engaging learning environment. 

Our lesson materials are collaboratively developed by our volunteer community. All of our lessons are open source, and are hosted on 
<a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. 

To request a workshop at your institution, visit the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/request/) or [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/workshops-host/) workshop request pages.
