### Instructors
Carpentry Instructors are the core of our community. Instructors organize and teach Carpentry workshops to spread data literacy and programmatic skills both locally and globally. Members of our Instructor community work together to actively grow their instructional and technical skills. Becoming an Instructor is a great step to leveling-up your own technical skills and helps you to become a more effective technical communicator. 

[Training](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/)
Responsibilities: 

Teach at least one workshop within your first year as an Instructor. Teach at least one workshop every two years to stay a voting member of the Carpentry community.
