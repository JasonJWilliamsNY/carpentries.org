Attending a [Carpentries workshop](../workshops/) builds the skills and perspectives
to work more effectively and reproducibily with data and software. You will build a skill set
that will help you 
use code to replicate operations or clean up data, automate routine tasks and help you on the way to doing robust, reproducible research, as well as the confidence to continue learning.

We create a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery. All workshop participants are required to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html) to ensure that all attendees to have a positive learning experience. Workshops are currently designed for people with little to no prior computational experience. Have a look at some [learner profiles](../audience/) and read some [testimonials](../testimonials/) to what others have found useful.

See more information on [the workshops we offer](../workshops), including Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry.
