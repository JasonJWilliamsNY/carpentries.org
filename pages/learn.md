Attending a [Carpentries workshop]({{site.url}}/workshops/) builds a great skill set that will help you automate
routine tasks, use code to replicate operations or clean up data, and help you on the way to doing robust, reproducible research.

Our workshops are designed for beginners. Have a look at some [learner profiles](https://software-carpentry.org/audience/) and read some [testimonials](https://software-carpentry.org/testimonials/) to what others have found useful. 

All Carpentries instructors have completed [instructor training](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/index.html). Once badged as an Instructor, you can go on to teach workshops. Find more about teaching and hosting workshops [in our handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html).
